##### blank node
A locally-scoped identifier that is used to refer to a resource when a globally scoped identifier is either inappropriate, as in the case of transient data, or not provided.  A blank node is prefixed with an underscore (_) and is scoped to the document in which it is used (e.g., _:a1).

##### IRI
The Internationalized Resource Identifier (IRI) extends the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) scheme by using characters drawn from the Universal Character Set rather than ASCII.  The IRI is a globally scoped identifier used in linked data to refer to most nodes and properties.  An IRI reference may be absolute or relative to that of another absolute IRI.  In JSON-LD relative IRIs are resolved relative to the base IRI.

#### ISO 8601
Caliper dates are based on ISO 8601 with the addition of millisecond precision.  The format is yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.SSSZ where 'T' separates the date from the time while 'Z' indicates that the time is in UTC.
